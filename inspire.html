    		<h1>John Elway</h1>

        		What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Hard-working and determined. Elway was always true to his code.</li>
        		<li>Iconic. John Elway is known for being one of the greatest players of all time.</li>
            <li>Role model. Elway won the Walter Payton award in 1992 proving some characteristic traits off the field.</li> 
        		<li>Loyal. Elway spent his entire career with the Broncos and is now apart of the front office.</li>
        		
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		Over the course of my lifetime no single football player has impacted me as much as John Elway has. I have always admired his play and his passion off the field. Elway is recognized as the greatest Bronco player of all time and provides a great example to all players in the NFL. There is never going to be another person like him as he has a legendary status.
